"""
This major module provides the execution of the algorithm of the OMI calculation.

First, the algorithm can be used to compute the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), which serve as a new basis for
the OLR data. Second, the time-dependent coefficients of the OLR maps w.r.t the EOFs are computed. These coefficients
are called the principal components (PCs).

According to the OMI algorithm, the EOFs have to be computed for each day of the year (DOY).

Basically, only OLR data on a suitable spatial grid is needed. With that, the the OMI EOFs and afterwards the PCs are
computed using the functions :func:`calc_eofs_from_olr` and :func:`calculate_pcs_from_olr`, respectively.

The complete algorithm is described in Kiladis, G.N., J. Dias, K.H. Straub, M.C. Wheeler, S.N. Tulich, K. Kikuchi, K.M.
Weickmann, and M.J. Ventrice, 2014: A Comparison of OLR and Circulation-Based Indices for Tracking the MJO.
Mon. Wea. Rev., 142, 1697â€“1715, https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-13-00301.1

An additional post-processing step can be run after the EOFs have been calculated that reduces noise and potential 
degeneracy issues. This algorithm is described in  Weidman, S., Kleiner, N., & Kuang, Z. (2022). A rotation procedure 
to improve seasonally varying empirical orthogonal function bases for MJO indices. Geophysical Research Letters, 
49, e2022GL099998. https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL099998
