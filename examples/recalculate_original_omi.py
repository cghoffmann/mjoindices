This example reproduces the original OMI values described in Kiladis, G.N., J. Dias, K.H. Straub, M.C. Wheeler,
S.N. Tulich, K. Kikuchi, K.M. Weickmann, and M.J. Ventrice, 2014: A Comparison of OLR and Circulation-Based Indices
for Tracking the MJO. Mon. Wea. Rev., 142, 1697â€“1715, https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-13-00301.1

A scientific description of the software package used by this example (mjoindices) is found in
Hoffmann, C.G., Kiladis, G.N., Gehne, M. and von Savigny, C., 2021: A Python Package to Calculate the
OLR-Based Index of the Madden-Julian-Oscillation (OMI) in Climate Science and Weather Forecasting.
Journal of Open Research Software, 9(1), p.9. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.331

We kindly ask you to cite both papers if you use computed results in your scientific publications.

The script may run for about 2 hours on common desktop computers.

You can modify this example in order to compute OMI data from other OLR datasets (this is probably what you intend if
you use this package).  For this, you only have to provide your OLR data as a mjoindices.olr_handling.OLRData object and
use this object as replacement for the original data in two lines, which is mentioned in the comments below.

This example also produces some diagnostic plots. More evaluation can be done afterwards with the script
evaluate_omi_reproduction.py.

# original values, the calculation strict_leap_year_treatment=True is somewhat more stringently implemented using

# Two EOF post-processing types are currently available: The original approach according to Kiladis (2014) and the
# EOF rotation approach according to ...
# In the original postprocessing, the signs of the EOFs are adjusted and the EOFs in a period
# around DOY 300 are replaced by an interpolation see Kiladis (2014).

# ToDo: (Sarah): Modify docs to point to your code and paper. I think we should not add a call to your pp version here,
# because the example is intended to recalculate the original OMI. Moreover, I would prever not to have an additional
# full example, because this adds a lot of testing work in future changes. Maybe you find an elengant way to point the user

# with the references and we simply refer to this document in all places, where we have the feeling that this information is relevant?
