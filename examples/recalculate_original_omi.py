This example reproduces the original OMI values described in Kiladis, G.N., J. Dias, K.H. Straub, M.C. Wheeler,
S.N. Tulich, K. Kikuchi, K.M. Weickmann, and M.J. Ventrice, 2014: A Comparison of OLR and Circulation-Based Indices
for Tracking the MJO. Mon. Wea. Rev., 142, 1697â€“1715, https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-13-00301.1

A scientific description of the software package used by this example (mjoindices) is found in
Hoffmann, C.G., Kiladis, G.N., Gehne, M. and von Savigny, C., 2021: A Python Package to Calculate the
OLR-Based Index of the Madden-Julian-Oscillation (OMI) in Climate Science and Weather Forecasting.
Journal of Open Research Software, 9(1), p.9. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.331

We kindly ask you to cite both papers if you use computed results in your scientific publications.

Furthermore, we have received the first adaptions of the OMI algorithm from the community. These modifications are not
covered by Kiladis (2014), but are typically described in other scientific publications before their integration into the
package (if they are not only of technical nature). While we designed the default settings such that the original OMI values
will be reproduced (which also applies to this example), you might want to check the documentation
(https://cghoffmann.github.io/mjoindices/index.html) of the major function calls below to get an overview of the available
options. Furthermore, a list of all scientific publications on which the package is based is available
(https://cghoffmann.github.io/mjoindices/references.html). Please also cite any papers on the list that describe the options
you used for the calculations. So far, possible options include an alternative post-processing approach for the EOFs,
and a possibility to work with data without leap years.

You can modify this example in order to compute OMI data from other OLR datasets (this is probably what you intend if
you use this package). For this, you only have to provide your OLR data as an mjoindices.olr_handling.OLRData object and
use this object as a replacement for the original data in two lines, which is mentioned in the comments below.

This example script may run for about 2 hours on common desktop computers.

This example also produces some diagnostic plots. More evaluation can be done afterwards with the script
evaluate_omi_reproduction.py.
